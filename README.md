# Sector-Wise-Volatility-Clustering
Identify volatility patterns across different sectors using clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques.
Dataset: NIFTY 50 Daily Log Returns (Last 5 Years)
Goal: Identify volatility patterns across different sectors using clustering
and dimensionality reduction techniques.
Tasks:
Compute rolling standard deviation (volatility) of stock returns.
Apply PCA to capture dominant volatility trends.
Perform K-Means clustering on principal component scores.
Visualize cluster-wise volatility behaviour and sector grouping.
Outcome: Detect groups of stocks showing similar volatility
characteristics and understand sector-level risk co-movements.
